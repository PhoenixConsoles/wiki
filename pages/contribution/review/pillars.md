# Pillars of Open Information

## Goals

In our mission of shared knowledge, we dedicate ourselves to:

- Accessibility
- Accuracy
- Community leadership
- Reliability
- Ease of Contribution
- Decentralization
- Activity

## Execution

To that end we execute these goals accordingly:

### Accessibility

- Automated translation system for wiki pages with manual review to be done by the community. [To be implemented]
- Video content posted to the Phoenix Consoles YouTube must be manually captioned and additional captions in other languages added through automated processes, subject to manual review and editing by the community. A described video option must also be made available. Audio dubs and caption translations can be submitted via the [Issue tracker]( {{site.baseurl}}/issues), [Contact Us](https://www.phoenixconsoles.org/contactus), or by [contacting an administrator]( {{site.baseurl}}/contactadmin). 
- Embedded images must have sufficiently descriptive alt-text available that effectively portrays the contents of the image without need for visually seeing the image. A user should be able to read the text and be able to accurately understand the contents of the image without the need of seeing the image.

### Accuracy

- A well-documented, community-driven review system.
- Mandated citations and references for additions.

### Community Leadership

- Community interaction via Discord, GitHub, and more!

### Reliability

- Ensure adherance to external resource host content policies to ensure content is not removed, requiring time to find new hosting for the content or potential loss of content.

### Ease of Contribution

- Templates for issues and pages.
- Guides on how to contribute.
- Editable through web browser.

### Decentralization

- Download the site via git, web, or torrent.[TO BE IMPLEMENTED]

### Activity

- Building an active, automated, user-led community to reignite the spark of console gaming, development, etc.
- Remaining active and interactive with the community and users.
