# Content Review Standards

As an open information project we feel it is vital to be open about our review processes. This is where you learn about them.

## General review

**All content must be reviewed for compliance with our respective hosting services content policies as well as our [Submitted Content Policy]( {{site.baseurl}}/contentpolicy)**

1. Upon submission, the content is to be reviewed for compliance with our content policy.
2. Any additions, removals, modifications, etc. needed are made known to the contributor in a reply through their original submission method.
3. Once adequate submissions/edits are made by the original contributor or other contributors, the content is to be edited(as necessary) and added to the resources it is fit for.

### Reviewing page edits and new pages

- Additionally, these edits go through the automated GitHub pull request process, requiring sufficient verification by prior contributors to succeed. [TO BE IMPLEMENTED]

## YouTube content review

### General

- Captions/dubs/videos are checked to verify they are syncronous.

### Reviewing video

- Additionally, videos are watched fully with any associated multimedia (audio, captions, etc.) for review.
- During viewing, writeup of the captions and described video is to also be done. Preferably, this is provided to us by the submitter.

### Reviewing audio dubs

- Additionally these are to be listened to by a speaker of the language for review.
- During listening, they are to also be captioned.

### Reviewing described video

- Described video is to be listened to for review and to confirm that it is adequate for understanding the video without seeing the video.

### Reviewing captions

- Captions are to be read for review.
