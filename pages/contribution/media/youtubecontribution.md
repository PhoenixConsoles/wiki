# Contributing videos to the Phoenix Consoles YouTube channel

**Disclaimer: Videos uploaded to our YouTube channel may be monetized.**

Contributing videos to be uploaded to our YouTube and embedded in our pages is extremely helpful for readers in providing a full understanding of the content of our wiki. However, we have opted for a preservation-focused model which requires we have permission to modify and upload the videos which we post to our YouTube and embed in our pages. As such, here's everything you need to know about contributing videos to the Phoenix Consoles Wiki and YouTube channel.

### Written permission, crediting, and ownership

We require that the submitter be the owner of the video that they submit, and that they provide us with written permission to use and modify the video in whatever manner we see fit. They must also provide us with information on how they wish to be credited. They can be credited as "Anonymous", a pseudonym of their choice, or by their real name. The video credits may be mentioned in the intro of the YouTube video, watermarked in the video in an area which does not affect the contents and/or readability of the video and/or credited in the page directly underneath the embedded video. The submitter is responsible for the videos they submit.

### Submitting videos

Videos may be submitted through:

- the Issues system; using the "Video Submission" template, filling it out, attaching the video file(if able, otherwise uploading it to a file host and linking as appropriate. Please use reputable file hosts such as MediaFire.), and submitting the issue. Then, a administrator will be able to review, edit, and upload the video to the YouTube channel and embed the video into the appropriate page(s) and close the issue.
- By contacting a Phoenix Consoles administrator through the [Contact Us](https://www.phoenixconsoles.org/contactus) page with your: image, written permission, and credit preference.
