# Contributing images to the Phoenix Consoles Wiki

Contributing images to be embedded in our pages is extremely helpful for readers in providing a full understanding of the content of our wiki. However, we have opted for a preservation-focused model which requires we have permission to modify and host the images we embed in our pages. As such, here's everything you need to know about contributing images to the Phoenix Consoles Wiki.

### Written permission, crediting, and ownership

We require that the submitter be the owner of the photo that they submit, and that they provide us with written permission to use and modify the photo in whatever manner we see fit. They must also provide us with information on how they wish to be credited. They can be credited as "Anonymous", a pseudonym of their choice, or by their real name. The photo credits may be watermarked in the photo in an area which does not affect the contents and/or readability of the photo and/or credited in the page directly underneath the embedded image. The submitter is responsible for the images they submit.

### Submitting images

Images may be submitted through:

- the Issues system; using the "Image Submission" template, filling it out, attaching the image, and submitting the issue. Then, a contributor will be able to add the photo to the appropriate page(s) and close the issue.
- through a commit and pull request adding the Image to the `_media` folder in the appropriate spot in the filesystem. (Learn more at the ["Filesystem"]( {{site.baseurl/filesystem}}) page.) and to the appropriate spot in the page with credits as appropriate. By following this method, you must also comment on the pull request with your written permission for use of the photo by Phoenix Consoles as seen fit and confirm you are the owner of the photo.
- By contacting a Phoenix Consoles administrator through the [Contact Us](https://www.phoenixconsoles.org/contactus) page with your: image, written permission, and credit preference.
