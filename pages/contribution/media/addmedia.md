# How to: Add media to the Phoenix Consoles Wiki

If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a video is worth (1000 * frames per second * length of video in seconds). That's a lot of words. Here's how to do it:

### Adding video content

#### Adding embedded video content

All embedded video content is to be hosted on the Phoenix Consoles YouTube channel and embedded into pages via HTML. The reason for this is in the interest of preservation of content, and as such hosting it on a YouTube channel that we control, having the original video file(s) stored on devices we control, etc. allows us to reduce various possibilities in which content is lost by keeping the content and backups within our control. See ["Contributing videos to the Phoenix Consoles YouTube channel"]( {{site.baseurl}}/youtubecontribution) for more information.

#### Adding embedded image content

All embedded image content is to be stored in the `_media` folder and embedded into pages via markdown. The reason for this is in the interest of preservation of content, and as such hosting it on the GitHub repo, having the original image(s) stored on devices we control, etc. allows us to reduce various possibilities in which content is lost by keeping the content and backups within our control. See ["Contributing images to the Phoenix Consoles Wiki"]( {{site.baseurl}}/imagecontribution) for more information.

#### Referencing content not controlled by Phoenix Consoles

Media content that is not controlled by Phoenix Consoles can be referenced and linked but not embedded.
