# The Phoenix Consoles Wiki

### The ultimate resource on consoles and related topics

This wiki is a community-driven open information project about consoles, electronics, repair, development, homebrew, and ethical hacking for the purpose of education, archival, and reduction of electronic waste.

## Features

### Would you like to request a feature, documentation, or contribute? [Submit an issue!]( {{site.baseurl}}/pages/issues/)

Some features of our wiki include:

- Links to *ask questions* and *make suggestions* via GitHub Issues.
- *Make edits* directly on GitHub.
- *Search* pages and documentation to find what you are looking for.
- *Automation* through Jekyll and GitHub Actions, making it easy to add, edit, and change the wiki.
- *Review* through a community-driven system and our wiki administration and moderation teams.
- [Templates for adding pages to the wiki to simplify the process.](templates/)
- [A How to Contribute page that outlines everything you need to know about contributing to the wiki.](howtocontribute)

## GitHub Integration

### This site is hosted via GitHub Pages with a custom domain! Pretty cool, right? It gets better...

Github also provides an entire framework for the wiki to become a successful, community-driven project! From Issues to Actions and so much more, GitHub makes an excellent home for the website. Therefore it is *vitally important* that the GitHub Terms of Service are followed perfectly, no less, as being removed from GitHub would lead to unnecessary time-waste and resource loss, as well as downtime (which is never good).
